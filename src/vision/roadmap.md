# 📅 The roadmap: what we're doing in 2021

This page describes the current plans for 2021.
It is updated on a monthly basis.

### 🛑 Not time for this yet 🛑

We're not really ready to work on this section yet. We're still focused on writing out the [status quo](./status_quo.md). What you see here are really just placeholders to give you the idea of what this section might look like.

## Key

| Emoji | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 🥬 | "Healthy" -- on track with the plan as described in the doc |
| ✏️ |  "Planning" -- Still figuring out the plan |
| 🤒 | "Worried" -- things are looking a bit tricky, plans aren't working out |
| 🏖️ | "On vacation" -- taking a break right now |
| ⚰️ | We gave up on this idea =) |
