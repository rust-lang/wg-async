# ✨ Shiny future stories: template

*This is a template for adding new "shiny future" stories. To propose a new shiny future PR, do the following:*

* *Create a new file in the [`shiny_future`] directory named something like `Alan_loves_foo.md` or `Grace_does_bar_and_its_great.md`, and start from [the raw source from this template]. You can replace all the italicized stuff. :)*
* *Do not add a link to your story to the [`SUMMARY.md`] file; we'll do it after merging, otherwise there will be too many conflicts.*

*For more detailed instructions, see the [How To Vision: Shiny Future] page!*
