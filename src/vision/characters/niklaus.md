## Niklaus: new programmer from an unconventional background

He's always been interested in programming but doesn't have experience with it. He's been working as a tech writer and decided to dip his toe in by opening PRs to improve the documentation for one of the libraries he was playing with. The feedback was positive so he fixed a small bug. He's now considering getting involved in a deeper way.
