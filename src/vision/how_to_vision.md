## Making the vision real

We are currently working towards implementing the async vision described in the [shiny future] section. On the [roadmap] page, you can get an overview of the major goals that are part of implementing that future and how we have divided up the work. Each of the goals also has several initiatives, and those initiatives have upcoming milestones. If you'd like to participate in an initiative, you can find the appropriate Zulip stream and see if they are looking for help!

### Goal and initiative owners

Each top-level goal and initiative in the [roadmap] has an *owner*. The owner is the one generally planning out and tracking that goal. You can learn more about the [responsibilities of owners](./how_to_vision/owner.md) in this page. If you have questions about whether you can help out with a goal or an initiative, the owner is probably the one to talk to.

[responsibilities of owners]: ./how_to_vision/owner.md

### Help wanted goals

Some of the top-level goals are marked with ✋, which means "help wanted". Those goals are looking for an owner. If you think you might be interested, you can read about the [responsibilities of owners] and contact the [wg leads].

## Living document

Although many of the pieces are complete, the vision doc is a living document and it will never be done. During the brainstorming period, we had a [lot of stories submitted](./submitted_stories.md) and we are now in the process of "harmonizing" those into a small set of [status quo] and [shiny future] narratives, each based around a representative [project] and the same set of [characters]. If you'd like to help out with that, contact the [wg leads].

We also plan to have regularly periods where we revisit the vision once we've made significant progress on implementation or if new information has come to light.

### Submitting status quo and shiny future story PRs

Although the brainstorming period has ended, we are still open to new PRs, particularly if they cover space that has not been well covered:

* [Templates and instructions for status quo stories can be found here.][hvsq] 
* [Templates and instructions for shiny future stories can be found here.][hvsf]

### Wait, did somebody say awards?

Yes! We are planning on giving [awards] in various categories for folks who write [status quo](./how_to_vision/status_quo.md) and [shiny future](./how_to_vision/shiny_future.md) PRs. The precise categories are TBD. Check out the [awards] page for more details.
