## The big picture

The process for writing the vision doc encourages active collaboration and "position sum" thinking. It begins with a **brainstorming period** in which we are inviting people to describe their experiences as "status quo" stories; later on, we'll start accepting "shiny future" stories. At the end of the brainstorming period, we will be giving [awards] and then work on **harmonizing** the stories into a coherent whole.

### Brainstorming

The brainstorming period runs until 2021-04-30:

* Folks [open status quo][hvsq] and (eventually) [shiny future][hvsf] narrative [PRs][repo].
* We collectively [comment] on these PRs, helping to improve them and make them more complete.
* At the end of the brainstorming period, we will vote and give [awards] for things like "most amusing". (We'd like suggestions on the best categories!)
* All PRs opened in this section will be merged into a "brainstorming" folder; they become the basis for the final document.

**During this brainstorming period, we want to focus on getting as many ideas as we can.** Having multiple "shiny futures" that address the same problem is a feature, not a bug, as it will let us mix-and-match later to try and find the best overall plan. Comments and questions will be used as a [tool for improving understanding or sharpening proposals.][c] Presenting alternative ideas is done by [writing an alternative narrative][alt].

### Harmonizing

At this point, the [wg leads] will write the draft vision document, drawing on the status quo and shiny future stories that were submitted.
Like an RFC, this draft vision doc will be opened for comment and improved based on the resulting feedback.
When the [wg leads] feel it is ready, it will be taken to the [lang] and [libs] teams for approval (and other Rust teams as appropriate).

### Living document

This meant to be a **living document**. We plan to revisit it regularly to track our progress and update it based on what we've learned in the meantime. Note that the shiny future stories in particular are going to involve a fair bit of uncertainty, so we expect them to change as we go.

## Wait, did somebody say awards?

Yes! We are planning to give [awards] in various categories for folks who write [status quo](./how_to_vision/status_quo.md) and [shiny future](./how_to_vision/shiny_future.md) PRs. The precise categories are TBD. Check out the [awards] page for more details.
