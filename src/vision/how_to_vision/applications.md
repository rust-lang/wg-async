# ‚ùì How to vision: Domains

[ld]: ../domains.md
[wg leads]: ../welcome.md#leads

## What is this?

We aim for the [list of domains][ld] to be comprehensive. Feel free to open PRs that either add new domains or adjust the wording on 
existing ones. The [wg leads] may choose however not to add an application, or to generalize an existing category instead.

## FAQs to answer in your PR

In your PR, make sure to include the following FAQs (and potentially others):

* What makes this application different from most others?
* What are some examples of crates in this category?
    * We have to be careful with this, we don't want it to seem like we're picking favorites, but we also don't want the pressure to be comprehensive. Maybe we can link to crates.io tags or something?
