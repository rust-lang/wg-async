# âš¡ Domains

## What is this

This section describes the kinds of domains where Async Rust is used. As you can see, there are quite a few, and we're surely missing some! For each domain, we also have a short description and some frequently asked questions that help to identify what makes this domain special. 

## Domains

* [Operating systems](./domains/os.md)
* [Embedded devices](./domains/embedded.md)

### Don't find a domain that fits what you use async Rust for?

We just started creating this list, and it's obviously very incomplete. We would welcome PRs to flesh it out! Here is a list of domains we came up with when brainstorming that may be useful:

- Web site
- High performance server
- High performance disk I/O
- Web framework
- Protocol or other leaf libraries (e.g., HTTP, QUIC, Redis, etc)
- SDKs for web services
- Middleware and other sorts of "wrapper" libraries (e.g., async-compression)
- Media streaming
- Consumer of web services (e.g., running things on a compute service, storing and retrieving things with a storage service)
- Embedded server
- Embedded client
- GUI application
- Parallel data processing
- Distributed HPC (compute clusters)
- Database clients
- Database servers
- Async runtimes for others to use
- Operating systems
