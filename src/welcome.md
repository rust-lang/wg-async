# üëãüèΩ Welcome

Welcome to the home of wg-async! This working group is focused
around implementation/design of the ‚Äúfoundations‚Äù for Async I/O.

You can learn more by reading our [charter].

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting involved

We have several [meetings] throughout the month. Feel free to stop by then (or any time!) to introduce yourself. We take meeting notes and keep them on our [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@wg-async).

If you're interested in fixing bugs, though, there is no need to wait for the meeting! [Take a look at the instructions here.][fix-bugs]

We are actively working on bringing the [async vision] to reality, so there are lots of ways to help.
Check out the [Roadmap] to see the various things we are working on.
Each of the high level goals should have further instructions for how to get starting helping with that goal in particular.
Look for the üõ†Ô∏è icon, which highlights areas where further how to help resources are available.
