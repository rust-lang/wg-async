# 👋🏽 Welcome

Welcome to the wg-async-foundations website!

## Leads

The leads of this working group are [@tmandry] and [@nikomatsakis]. Both of them can be found on [Zulip].

## 🛠️ Getting involved

There is a weekly [triage meeting] that takes place in our [Zulip stream][zulip]. Feel free to stop by then (or any time!) to introduce yourself.

If you're interested in fixing bugs, though, there is no need to wait for the meeting! [Take a look at the instructions here.][fix-bugs]

We are actively working on bringing the [async vision] to reality, so there are lots of ways to help.
Check out the [Roadmap] to see the various things we are working on.
Each of the high level goals should have further instructions for how to get starting helping with that goal in particular.
Look for the 🛠️ icon, which highlights areas where further how to help resources are available.

[triage meeting]: ./triage.md
[fix-bugs]: ./triage.md#so-you-want-to-fix-a-bug
[async vision]: ./vision.md
[Roadmap]: ./vision/roadmap.md

## What is the goal of this working group?

This working group is focused around implementation/design of the “foundations” for Async I/O. This means that we are focused on designing and implementing extensions to the language, standard library, and other "core" bits of support offered by the Rust organization. We do not directly work on external projects like [tokio], [async-std], [smol], [embassy] and so forth, although we definitely discuss ideas and coordinate with them where appropriate.

[tokio]: https://tokio.rs/
[async-std]: https://async.rs/
[smol]: https://github.com/smol-rs/smol/
[embassy]: https://github.com/akiles/embassy
