# Glossary

If you follow discussions in the async ecosystem you're likely to find acronyms being tossed around, many of which refer to language features that are in-progress.
What follows is a best-effort list of those acronyms and links to resources discussing the language features.

## AFIT - async fn in trait
- [RFC #3185](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3185)
- Allows static dispatch of `async fn`s in traits

## RPITIT - return position `impl trait` in traits
- [RFC #3425](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3425)
- Allows `impl trait` as a return type in trait definitions

## RTN - return type notation
- [Tracking Issue: rust#109417](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/109417)
- Experimental, pre-RFC feature providing bounds for return types on `async fn`s
