# wg-async charter
<!--
 Provide an introduction summarising the goals and motivation behind your
 project group.
-->

## Goals

<!--
 Explain what changes you'd like to see your group your group to focus on, and
 how you plan to approach these issues. Focus on explaining the highest possible
 level of your change.
-->

This working group is focused around implementation/design of the “foundations” for Async I/O. This means that we are focused on designing and implementing extensions to the language, standard library, and other "core" bits of support offered by the Rust organization.

## Constraints And Considerations

We do not directly work on external projects like [tokio], [async-std], [smol], [embassy] and so forth, although we definitely discuss ideas and coordinate with them where appropriate.

[tokio]: https://tokio.rs/
[async-std]: https://async.rs/
[smol]: https://github.com/smol-rs/smol/
[embassy]: https://github.com/akiles/embassy


<!--
 Explain the scope of your group, what you have chosen not to include in
 your goals, and your motivations behind making them non-goals.
