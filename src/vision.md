# The vision

## WARNING: WIP

This vision section is still a work-in-progress!

## What is this

This section lays out a general vision and set of goals for Async I/O in Rust. This document is being written in January of 2021. The core pieces of async-await are stable, but there remains a lot of work for it to feel like a "first class" feature of Rust. 

This section describes three things:

* The **design tenets**, or principles, that we are using to drive our work on Async I/O in Rust;
* Descriptions of how writing Async I/O code in Rust **feels today**;
* Descriptions of how we think writing Async I/O code in Rust **should feel eventually**.

## Think big -- too big, if you have to

You'll notice that the ideas in this document are **maximalist and ambitious**. They stake out an opinionated position on how the ergonomics of Async I/O should feel. This position may not, in truth, be attainable, and for sure there will be changes along the way. Sometimes the realities of how computers actually work may prevent us from doing all that we'd like to. That's ok. This is a dream and a goal.

## The vision drives the work

The vision is not just idyll speculation. It is the central document that we use to organize ourselves. When we think about our [roadmap](./roadmap.md) for any given year, it is always with the aim of moving us closer to the vision we lay out here. 

## Living document, updated regularly

This is a living document that is kept up to date. We meet on a regular basis to update the description of the status quo as we make progress. We also update our ideas of the target we are shooting for as we gain experience -- sometimes it turns out that we were wrong about how we thought things should work. That's ok!

## This is a group effort

As the leads of the Async Foundation group, Niko and Tyler are driving and organizing this document. But writing it and shaping it is a group effort. If you think there is a part of the async experience that is not reflected here, we want to hear from you! If you have an idea for how something could be awesome, we want to see you write it up! And if you're interested in helping bring some part of the vision to fruition, then we should talk.
